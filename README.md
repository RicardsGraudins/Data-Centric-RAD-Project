# Data Centric RAD 2016 Project
This repository contains code and information for my third-year undergraduate project for the module **Data Centric RAD.** The module is taught to undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie/) in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Physics. The lecturer is Gerard Harrison.

#### Project Guidelines TLDR:
> Write a JSF/JDBC dynamic web application that queries and updates a MySQL database.

#### What is JSF:  
JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a Java specification for building component-based user interfaces for web applications and was formalized as a standard through the Java Community Process being part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition. It is also a MVC web framework that simplifies construction of user interfaces for server-based applications by using reusable UI components in a page.

#### What is JDBC:
Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface for the programming language Java, which defines how a client may access a database. It is Java based data access technology and used for Java database connectivity. It is part of the Java Standard Edition platform, from Oracle Corporation. It provides methods to query and update data in a database, and is oriented towards relational databases. A JDBC-to-ODBC bridge enables connections to any ODBC-accessible data source in the Java virtual machine (JVM) host environment.

#### How to run:
**Note:** Some of the files that are required to run this project are not included in this repository. Setting this project up can be somewhat troublesome and outdated therefore, a step by step guide on how to run this project is not supplied. Keep in mind if you attempt to run this project additional resources must be added after importing such as the `JSF library` and you must set up your own MySQL database with the name `garage`. A sample database has been supplied in the **Resources** folder.
